It took a while for Marvel to make a martial arts film, and they certainly couldn't have done better by roping in Destin Daniel Cretton for his character-driven directing repertoire and Tony Leung - the master of Asian cinema - for his first English language role. The fight choreography is the highlight of the movie, while the newish cast - Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Me'gher Chang deliver memorable performances playing their action hero roles with a touch of humour. The film's climax - with dragons and monsters - feels somewhat cheesy after its brilliant first half, but hey it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without CGI monsters. Overall, Shang-Chi is a fun movie for multiple repeated viewings.\",\n",

Marvel has created another masterpiece alongside Black Panther with excellent cinematography, A-1 story telling from the origin, to the subtle demolishing of Asian American stereotypes, the cameos that bring the marvel universe into unity, and even to the timing of the comic relief. These characters knew the assignment and delivered top tier performances in the choreography, plus the VFX was on Snyder's team level, imo. Arguably the best Marvel movie to date. But also one of the best Kung Fu movies in its own lane. This new Phase in the saga has a bright future if they're coming in this hot.

This takes all of that, adds classic Chinese storytelling, beautiful special effects, and smacks it right into the middle of the MCU. It's not the movie I expected, it's so much better. I went into this expecting just another MCU action flick. Fun, but ultimately just another superhero story. Instead, it's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon meets Doctor strange, and one of the best movies I've seen in years.\",\n",

Does it have some points of improvement? Sure. The immersion was broken a handful of times for me, however all together I loved the journey I was taken on.

So awesome to get super powers along side of martial arts. The CGI was so amazing especially at the end. The comedy was perfectly placed. The music/film score was so well put together.

It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer.\",\n",

The character work is very well done, you enjoy the energy everyone brings to the scene and the movie stands firmly on it's own.

So if you take that away from her, she's just there to be the strong and independent woman, which is fine, but I wish they had done more with her.And last, Death Dealer, he had an interesting design and the mask, so I expected something interesting about him, but there was nothing LOL.Other than that, the movie is amazing, Tony Leung was great, his death scene broke my heart.\",\n",

Michelle Yeoh is great in the film and I've seen her in films like Tomorrow Never Dies and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.

I would have missed it, had it not been for the chance encounter with Anushka (as I had not gotten my protein at the Fitness Park stall)I am glad I took his advice and met her.The movie has a storyline that is believable with the motivations of the villain very realistic. The poor guy only wanted to relive his glory days with his family (kind of like the kingpin in \"Spiderman-Into the Spiderverse\"). He was holding on to the emotion for longer than intended. Tony Leung is a spectacular actor and portrays an immense amount of emotion through his eyes. It was a pleasure to watch his scenes\\nAwkwafina breathes happiness into every scene that she is a part of.Michel Yeoh really shows to us what a mature actor looks like.But the one who takes the cake is Ben Kingsley. His scenes, especially the one where he describes his motivation for becoming an actor are gold.Maybe a movie on an Indian Marvel superhero off the comics Paras Gavaskar (the Jain mutant who practices non-violence but want to stop evil), Dinesh Deol (an engineer capable of psychokinesis) or Paras Gavaskar, Shakti Haddad (the brilliant expert in genetics who can locate mutants, and manipulate nervous systems) is not too far.',\n",

Leung, Yeoh, and Zheng - all A++ performances. It was just a truly solid cast... Not a weak or even marginal performance from any of the cast. Just loved the movie!! It was fun seeing a couple of Avengers (Danvers and Banner) in the final moments. Nice nods to the MCU throughout. The mid-credit scene is awesome and hysterical! Wong is terrific and appears to be setting up sequels and future interactions / crossovers with perhaps Doctor Strange and others. Same for the late-credit scene.

When I think about it, that was something new when it comes to Marvel. The main character seems personable and it's fun to watch his story unfold. What I can tell you is that this tells the story of how Shang-Chi got the ten rings.

              " 'I had low expectations for this movie. First off, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. It\\'s so god damn beautifully well-done. The storyline is extremely brilliant where it explores how this man found the Ten Rings that gifted him with unlimited power and immortality that kept him alive for thousands of years, would create an organization known as the Ten Rings who would later be responsible for the Kidnapping of Tony Stark in Afghanistan, Aldrich Killian\\'s madness.After their job, the two ride on a bus, but only to encounter the Ten Rings and a guy with a \"freakin\\' machete\". I have to say, though. This scene\\'s choreography was god damn great, and the music made it even better. After the attack, Katy begins to question Shang\\'s motives. Shang explains the backstory of how he came to be, and that he needed to go visit his long-lost sister. They take the airplane to China. The two arrive in this underground fighting club that was broadcasted to the Dark Web only to encounter a guy who told him to sign to fight, even though Shang didn\\'t know what he was signing up for. We get to see a cameo of the Abomination fighting Wong. I have to say that the CGI was better on him in every level. I am quite glad that the writers are starting to acknowledge The Incredible Hulk. Shang is up to fight an unknown opponent, and it is revealed that it is his sister. Shang tries to talk to her that he doesn\\'t want to fight which basically led to him getting his *** kicked. (( Have to put asterisks so that IMDb won\\'t delete this review, so don\\'t be surprised. ))After the fight, Shang tells his sister, Xialing about the Ten Rings situation. They soon realize that the Ten Rings attack the club which leads us to another action scene. Unrelated, but I have noticed that people have been complaining that MCU Heroes don\\'t kill. I\\'m pretty sure that they did kill since the beginning where Iron Man used his Mark I to light his victims on fire, blowing up multiple people, fatal blasts, etc. The Death Dealer steals Xialing\\'s pendant, capturing the three of them to the Ten Rings Headquarters to reunite with their father waiting for them. Back at the Headquarters, Wenwu explains how there is still hope to save their mother by finding Ta Lo to save Ying. Wenwu uses the two pendants to place them on the dragon\\'s eyes generating a map made of water showing them the secret passage through the bamboo maze, and the perfect time where it can be granted. Wenwu tells them that if the people of Ta Lo won\\'t comply, he will burn down the village with no mercy. Shang is against this. Wenwu throws them in the catacombs. The three hear some weird noises only to encounter Trevor who was the Fake Mandarin in Iron Man 3! If you didn\\'t know, there was a short that explains Slattery\\'s experience in jail. In the end, he is captured by the Ten Rings. Morris comes out of the corner, telling Trevor the true path.Xialing discovers that there are escape routes, the team hijacks Razor\\'s car which leads us to another fight sequence. They soon approach the bamboo forest maze. Katy is assisted where to turn by Morris and Slattery. Finally, they enter a waterfall, arriving at the Ta Lo village. Guang Bo tells the group to turn back. Ying Nan delays that order, meeting her niece and nephew. Although, I did realize this was Michelle Yeoh who portrayed Philippa Georgiou in Star Trek: Discovery. I do need to catch up as I lost interest. Ying tells them a story where in ancient times, their village was attacked by this extra-dimensional draconic entity who can suck the ever-living souls out of people and its minions can, too. But, the Great Protector, and sealed away behind the Dark Gate, trapping it for many centuries. Here, we have a training montage where we see Shang-Chi being trained in the same arts that were used to defeat Wenwu, Xialing practices with this what seems to be a rope dart, and Chen learning archery. The next day, Wenwu and the Ten Rings, also Razor Fist, and the Death Dealer arrive. Nan tells Wenwu that his wife isn\\'t behind the Dark Gate, but the Soul Eaters were luring him to a trap.We begin the climactic third act. Nan fights with the Death Sealer, Xialing fights Razor Fist. Meanwhile, Shang notices his father walking away to his wife\\'s memorial, but is distracted by several warriors for a brief moment. As he approaches his father, he told him that he isn\\'t afraid. Episode V vibes here when Luke tells Yoda where he promises that he won\\'t fail him and not be afraid. \"Oh, you will be. You will be.\" They begin to fight until Wenwu uses the same movement that he killed the gang who killed his wife on Shang into the depths of water, believing that his son is dead. He does a Jedi Jump moment to the Dark Gates using the rings to break it down and free his wife. This makes the situation worse by releasing an army of Soul Eaters. In the village, Xialing tries to ally with Razor Fist to help to take down the Soul Eaters. His mind is changed when the Death Dealer\\'s soul was sucked out, he tells the Ten Rings to stop and help the villagers. I have to say, this part was terrifying and how he falls dead, no movement. It is crazy how death does that. Back to Shang-Chi, he regains consciousness with the help of the Great Protector rising out of the water. The Great Protector begins to eat the Soul Eaters. Shang-Chi makes his way to his father to furthermore convince him that his wife isn\\'t behind the Dark Gates. Wenwu ignores this, continuing the fight. Wenwu uses half of his rings at his son, but Shang catches them and gaining control of \\'em. The fight gets more intense to the point where the Dweller is unleashed and slowly absorbs Wenwu\\'s soul. During his final moments, he gives his son the rings. The battle suffered many losses including Master Guang Bo. Chen launches an arrow at the Dweller\\'s weak port, causing it to be weakened. The Great Protector starts to kick the ever-living crap outta it, making it explode. In the Aftermath, the villagers attend a ceremony as the lanterns of those who died slowly \"swam\" across the ocean. Finally, it was all about a true story where Shang was explaining his recent adventure to a couple. Obviously, they don\\'t believe him just until Wong uses his yellow sparkly thing bringing Shang and Katy to discuss the rings. We get a cameo of Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner. This time, Captain Marvel didn\\'t get another haircut, lol. Interesting how Professor Hulk somehow returned to his human form. I strongly assume that his right arm is more painful since he returned as a human. In the end credits, we see Xialing becoming the new leader of the Ten Rings.There are A LOT of fantastic characters here. Starting off with Shang-Chi, I have to say that he had an excellent performance where he seems to be brave, showing no cowardice to his father, has lovely chemistry with his best friend he had known for 10 years, Katy, wants nothing to do with his family, often feels guilty for leaving Xialing. I have to say, though. Speaking of Katy, I liked how she wasn\\'t full-on comedic throughout the film and became a badass. I do find it interesting that we have two archers now. Hawkeye and Katy. I quite like how we didn\\'t have any romance (( besides Wenwu\\'s romantic relationship with Ying Li. ))Wenwu. What to say on this. He is one of the best Marvel villains ever. Although, he wasn\\'t one, and he had actual motives rather than being the usual MCU villain, but the storytelling is wonderful. He was a ruthless leader killing multiple people. Then one day, he stumbled upon a woman, ditches away his organization, became a better caring & loving man to raise two children until his wife was killed, seeking revenge on her murder, became a flawed father having no time toward his children like ditching Xialing. What. A. Tragic. Story. I am starting to notice that Phase 4 is exploring the effects of grief like Wanda\\'s love for Vision, Sylvie\\'s hatred for the TVA, and Corrupted Doctor Strange trying to bring back his love. Tony Leung\\'s performance killed it. I loved how they were ditching away with the Mandarin stuff.I have to say that the Ten Rings (( no, not the organization. )) is completely badass, more interesting than the repulsors, the Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, a million-pound sharp-edged metal frisbee, the iconic Scepter, a cross-bow that can do many things, a prosthetic titanium/vibranium arm that can overpower almost anything, Quad Blasters that go pew pew, the Godslayer that can cut through anything, basic daggers, a laser cannon, yaka arrow that can travel by whistling, electroshock batons, carbon-fibered specialized winged jetpack, and vibranium claws. Wanda\\'s psionic energy manipulation, size/insect manipulation, web-shooters, eldritch magic, and the Infinity Gaunlet are the only cool things along with the Ten Rings. You can make an energy blast, put 10 rings on one arm to do a super-punch, extend into a energy whip, shields, big jumps, etc. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. The fight between Wenwu & Ying was god damn jaw-dropping. Wenwu is a 10/10 character.For Xu Xialing, she became likable in the later halfs of the movie. Her backstory is heartbreaking, because of her gender, she couldn\\'t train with her brother Shang. Although, she learned to train on her own. Rather than her unpleasant behavior, she has great bonds with women, emotional, a really interesting relationship with her brother. For Ying Nan, she is marvellous. She dealt with the loss of her sister, and wise. I enjoyed Guang Bo so much, he\\'s wise, has a deep heart for his village. I was devastated of his death. Trevor. I enjoyed so much for him and his deep relationship for Morris, he is so fun! \"Calm down, mate. I\\'m not actually dead, it\\'s just a performance, play along.\" I do wish that the Death Dealer was done better rather than being treated dirty. He was badass, completely threatening, and the same potential of Taskmaster. The movie has excellent pacing, that\\'s all I have to say.',\n",

Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night.\",\n",

First the film is simply stunning for the moving forest at the start, to the character visual designs it was truly immersive. Where the film truly shines though is the action scenes, the way they shot the scene on that bus from someone that appreciates films was MIND BLOWING! The one take where he\\'s fighting across the broken in half bus was amazing very similar to daredevil.Marvel also had a great villain in the mandarin with a very relatable reason for his actions and not just wants the kill everyone. Comedy held up very well from the supporting cast the plane scene when there pronouncing his name was something out of rush hour and I loved it.The final act of the film was when I worried the most as I knew a CGI fest was coming but the action was simply the best I\\'ve ever scene. Riding a dragon and doing a dragon ball z blast with the rings it literally gave me goose bumps and actually hit emotion notes for me in the family issues department when he confronts his dad saying \"is this what you wanted\" when they are fighting next To the river.

This is the most Asian and action-packed incredible motion picture in existence. Something that makes me proud to be a Marvel fan. A cinematic masterpiece. Simu Liu is an underrated actor.

The acting was amazing when it came from the amazing actors (obviously). Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh are legends and acted accordingly. Simu Liu will rightfully be a superstar because of his performance. I want to see more of Meng\\'er Zhang, I think that she has huge potential.

Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel, Bruce Banner aka the Hulk and Doctor Strange\\'s right hand man Wong made cameo appearances in the mid-credits scene.

Only had good things to say about this film. Great visuals, beautiful landscapes, action-packed scenes as well as the martial arts were the best ever captured on the big screen. The film felt authentic to the Chinese culture and the cast were perfect. The predominantly Asian & Asian-American cast shows an important step forward towards cultural representation in these big budget blockbuster films, and it's nice to not only see Asian characters presented with none of the all-too-common stereotypes. It was also great to see moments that allowed for strong women to have their time to shine without it feeling forced . The comedic moments and timing were spot on and added even more flavour to this great film.A great start to Phase 4.

There was plenty of amazing martial arts action - my favorite was the first one on a runaway bus in San Francisco with 5 assassins and our reluctant hero. Also, there were magical creatures, a tragic love story, and a battle of good and evil. My older son is always the most critical of the three of us, and he loved it. His only criticism is that it wasn't much of a Marvel movie, but as an origin story, that did not bother me. There were 2 superhero cameos, and larger parts for Wong from Dr. Strange and Ben Kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the Iron Man 3.

              " 'How can I describe how much I love this movie?! I LOVED it! By far the best superhero movie of the year (until Spider-Man: No Way Home comes out).I grew up reading Marvel Comics (thanks Dad for the many visits to the local library). That\\'s how I became a huge fan of Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, The Avengers, etc. And Shang-Chi was one of those comics I read growing up. I watched so many Bruce Lee movies and wished that he was still alive to have at least played Shang-Chi back in the day. But then I got my wish this year!I really enjoyed the story of this film and it gives the backstory of the Ten Rings organization, as depicted first in 2008\\'s Iron Man. Tony Yeong was amazing as Wenwu, the OG Mandarin in the comics. He was just a father that wanted to reunite with his family and bring back his dead wife to be a family again. And I loved Simu Liu as Shang-Chi. He bodied the character very well and I loved the banter between him and Awkwafina\\'s character. I thought Awkwafina was gonna be annoying at first, but then I grew to love her character. I\\'m happy that Shang-Chi and Katy weren\\'t love interests in this one, but I don\\'t mind if we see them as a couple in the next one (and there will definitely be a next Shang-Chi film). It was a surprise that I get to see Abomination back in his true comic accurate form! And Wong fighting him?! Come on, that\\'s awesome! Ben Kingsley was a surprise to see. I loved him in this more than when he was \"acting\" as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. I really liked Shang-Chi\\'s sister, Xialing, who is a badass by the way. I loved the story and the characters and oh my God, the score and visuals was stunning!I loved the choreography of the many styles of Kung-Fu. The fighting was just spot on from what I\\'ve seen watching the Bruce Lee films. And I got to admit, Wenwu was an amazing villain. I put him up there with Thanos, Killmonger, Loki, Mysterio, Vulture, Red Skull and Ego the Living Planet.Overall, I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings a solid 10/10.',\n",

The main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of MCU, and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film. What many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth. But I'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the Shang Chi character, introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself. The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie.

Not only is the movie excellent - opening up a great story with wonderful, engaging characters, and great new locations - but something I don\\'t always think when I think \"Marvel movies\" is that there are many scenes in which I just thought to myself that they made a beautiful movie, too. It\\'s really too bad that this movie didn\\'t get the chance other Marvel movies got with a non-pandemic times movie theater release. It would\\'ve surely broken the 1-billion dollar mark.

As Marvel no longer had licensing rights to the name \"Fu Manchu,\" the hero\\'s villainous father had to be revised to being the true Mandarin (as opposed to Ben Kingsley\\'s politically incorrect caricature as a terrorist group figurehead).Then, there\\'s Shang-chi\\'s sister. Instead of Fah Lo Suee (another literary character licensed to the Estate of Sax Rohmer), we have Xu Xialing. And, for Shang-Chi\\'s girlfriend, we get American-born Katy. An original character who seems to be an amalgam of Leiko Wu and Misty Knight. Which only stands to reason, I suppose, as Shang-chi\\'s maternal heritage seems to amalgamate his silver screen origin with the comic book origin of Iron Fist!Most important of all, however, is the emotional plausibility. Simu Liu provides that, for this version of Shang-Chi, the same way Tobey Maguire first brought believability to the cinematic Peter Parker.All in all? Not a bad way to transition from the end of summer into the next phase of Marvel Films.',\n",

While many fans check out or get excited for a new Marvel movie simply because they like the series, I was stoked for this one because my cousin Gene Day worked as an artist on the comic book series that this is based on Master of Kung Fu. He was and artist on the series from issue 76-120 and co-created the character of Death Dealer who features in this movie. I had high expectations for this film because of my family connection and it didn't disappoint. Stunning visuals and exciting stunts elevate this film. While there are chanes from the original comics, these changes make sense and still fit within the overall scheme of the Marvel universe. Shang-Chi's father in the originals was Fu Manchu but since Marvel no longer owns the rights to the character, it makes sense to pick another strong Asian villain like The Mandarin to take his place. Overall a great addition to the Marvel universe.\",\n",

Then the action dipped a little in the middle. But, once Shang Chi and his gang escaped the stronghold of the 10 rings, the movie really took off. It was a magnificent freaking story. The legend, the fighting, the story, and the tremendous acting were all there. This is as good an MCU movie as there ever was. I was totally blown away by it. It was a great idea to have top actors in the movie and let them do their thing. The leads Simu Liu and Akwafina are solid but the burden of carrying the movie isn't entirely placed on their shoulders. Their parents and auntie (Tony Leung, Fala Chen, and Michelle Yeoh) have to do some of the dramatic heavy lifting.\",\n",

Tony Leung is without a doubt Tom Cruise + Tom Hanks in the Chinese/Hong Kong movie community. I grew up watching his films. He was a perfect cast. The use of mandarin (Chinese) in this film was spot on as well, though the translation could be better. I understand Chinese mandarin, and it was spot on. Only thing I ask of Marvel/Disney is somehow bring Tony Leung back. And maybe help the general public on how to properly pronounce Shang Chi. (Sh-on-Chi). Seriously, this movie was just like Black Panther, everything was spot on. I've seen this movie twice in theaters, and bought 4k collectors edition. Marvel/Disney, please continue to take my money. Thank you for creating amazing content and do justice to the Chinese & Chinese American & Chinese abroad justice.\",\n",

              " \"Filled with action, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is amongst some of the best storytelling in the entirety of the MCU. Between the family squandering, the epic, beautifully choreographed battles, the funny moments, and the amazing visuals, there is no flaw in this movie. The creatures in Ta Lo are amazing additions, especially the Dweller in Darkness. It was such a relief to finally get a villain that wasn't humanoid. Marvel needs to continue that path. This movie is a great example and leader for the diversification Marvel needs, and I hope they take the good reviews as proof that they can continue that. Simu Liu, Awkwafina, and Tony Leung Chiu-wai had amazing performances, and I can't wait to get more of Shang-Chi soon. In summary, I'd say this movie is proof that Marvel's future is secure in continuing to make great movies, between new, exciting characters, diversity, and stunning visual effects.\",\n",

In place of the main character, I wanted to see a strong, pumped-up person, and not a strong \"Pukhlyash\". But in general, if you do not find fault with the actors, then the plot of the film is done cool, even with strange moments that you do not expect at all, such as meeting with a headless animal, which additionally creates interest.Watching a movie creates a certain tension, because it is not clear what can happen next. And this mystery in the film also gives a certain zest.',\n",
              " 'The restless father Wenwu (Tony Leung Chu Wai), the beautiful mother Jiang Li (Chen Fala) and the tough sister Xialing (Meng\\'er Zhang) - were members of the same ordinary family that has experienced both the best and the worst of times. I don\\'t remember Disney and Marvel having a similar family history, and I\\'ll be careful not to disassemble it so as not to accidentally spoil it. We have seen different fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters over the years, and the relationship between many was special. In the case of the Shang-Chi family, the writers found some interesting solutions in the style of Asian \"fathers and sons\". And in general, the leitmotif in the film is the theme of the family, albeit against the backdrop of flying arrows, bo, sai daggers and swords. Incredibly beautifully filmed several romantic scenes that serve to some extent justify the motives of the actions of the main protagonist. And the idea that a mother and father coexist equally in a child, although not new, makes one wonder how many facets and nuances we all consist of.',\n",
              " '\"Shang-chi\" is conceived as a story of the formation of a hero who acquires supernatural abilities: like his father, he knows how to control ten magic rings. And the screenwriters managed to masterfully combine several themes in this story at once: heredity, reverence for elders (prevalent in Asian culture), the search for self, overcoming difficulties and awareness of their strengths.For once, the hero is really struggling with internal and external demons - remorse because of the abandoned family and abusive father, who could not really get attached to him. The conflict is based on understandable and simple emotions - pain, resentment and distrust - so it is surprisingly easy to sympathize with the main character. And when Shang-chi succeeds, the audience sees how hard he earned them. The strength of the film is not only in the main character, but in a whole group of interesting characters. Katie, played by Aquafina- is an ordinary girl without superpowers, an analogue of Darcy Lewis from the Thor films. Throughout the first half of the picture, she seems to personify the audience with popcorn in her hands, commenting on what is happening and constantly making jokes. But it\\'s not only Aquafina\\'s comedic talent that makes the heroine bright - closer to the finale it turns out to be very important for the plot. Sister Shang-chi Xialing perfectly combines great strength of character and at the same time the fragility of an offended, abandoned child.But the real attention of the viewer is stolen by Tony Leung Chu, who gave Marvel one of the best antagonists of recent years. Wenwu is a deeply tragic villain and a great example of how to make an antagonist multifaceted. The loss of his beloved wife really angered him, but Wenwu has always been ambitious, cruel and prone to violence. The authors of the film do not try to whitewash him, especially in unfair treatment of Shang-chi and Xialing. At the same time, you can understand Wenwu, sometimes you even want to root for him, but he remains a villain from the first to the last appearance.',\n",

It is also worth adding that this film is a superhero film from the world of Marvel, so fans of this should watch it, especially since the film turned out to be excellent.Plot: to be honest, I'm already confused about these super heroes, since Marvel (and not only) has a lot of them now) First, we are told the story of Xu Wenwu, who has artifacts in the form of Ten Rings in his hands. They are magical and endow this person with superpowers and besides this, immortality, as I understand it. But... he is not the main character of the film) The story will go on about his son Shang Chi.

There were no expectations from the film, perhaps this played a big plus in his assessment, the plot of the film makes you think from the first minutes, it shows how it all began, true love is shown, relationships and a certain mythical world are shown. This is exactly what you constantly expect from a film of this universe. And after watching a desire to watch the film further, to find out how everything will develop further.

              " 'In the last year, Disney has been leaning on Chinese cuisine. \"Mulan\", \"Raya and the Last Dragon\", and now \"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\". The set of ingredients is surprisingly similar: we collect time-tested techniques and plot elements, throw them into a pile, upload them to the neural network and create a script. Good savings come out during the pandemic, you don\\'t have to pay the screenwriters. In any case, I do not want to believe that these three projects had real licensed screenwriters, otherwise I will have to put up with the complete degeneration of the profession under the control of Disney. All three films are united by both the mentioned secondary nature and a disregard for the created world. The main thing is to introduce more mascotics to sell toys, and inclusivity, so that the press splashes with saliva. And the plot is for some strange people outside the target audience. The new film of the Marvel cinematic universe almost fell victim to many factors. The same scenario - it is bad, predictable, consists of everything that any viewer, whether he is a movie fan or just getting acquainted with cinema, has seen if not hundreds, then at least dozens of times. In the center, the main character is of Asian origin, living a quiet American life, but finding himself embroiled in a showdown of supernatural forces directly related to his past. He travels to different locations, meets his father, the villain, fights with him, and in the end reveals all his powers and enters into a confrontation with an older evil. Unless the main character does not turn into Mark Dakaskas, as in the TV series \"Killers of Wu\", but otherwise everything is like in a multi-series with Iko Yuvais. The second problem is the characters. Malomal charisma is possessed only by supporting actors and beyond. In the foreground, you have to look at the one-dimensional Sima Liu and Aquafina (the young lady compensates for the lack of charisma with zero acting and tantrums). Even the beauty Zhang Menger managed to depersonalize, age, and in the second half of the film completely deprive of replicas. 59-year-old Tony Leung has to carry drama and pathos, and 77-year-old Ben Kingsley has to carry humor. And what can you do if young people can\\'t cope? However, two absolutely important problems are destroyed at the click of the Infinity Gauntlet when old Chinese militants come into play. They were lovingly cut into fragments and filled to the brim with the possibilities of modern cinema. Here\\'s a fight on the bus, but on bamboo scaffolding - we have repeatedly seen all this at the same Jackie Chan. However, add to this a modern budget, special effects and the ability to shoot from almost any angle and get a completely new impression of the old as the world of movie fights. Yes, as in the script, it\\'s just tracing paper from repeatedly passed and digested. But with what a soul it is recreated! The action in \"Shang Chi\" is the best and most memorable part of the film. Ideally, one day I would like to see an \"anti-director version\" of the tape, where the entire plot and dialogues will be cut out, leaving 40-50 minutes of enjoyment for the eyes. It would be possible to continue to scold the film by putting a lower rating, but it will not work - the beauty of fights almost without firearms is enough here so that the movie does not upset, but on the contrary, awakens the belief that the most inclusive phase of the MCU will be better than it seems at the moment. It\\'s not worth waiting for miracles from the plot of the upcoming tapes right now, but at least it surprises the directors at least sometimes, but it still works out. So we sit until the end of the credits and go to sing karaoke, like all normal heroes-viewers who, despite the falling quality, still remain with Marvel.',\n",

The fight choreography was excellent, best I've seen in a while - dynamic, engaging, fresh. The soundtrack was also incredible.The film takes care to depict the lives of millenial Asian migrants, including all the karaoke (!) (Source: I am an Asian millennial migrant)Strongest point of the movie is the always-superb Tony Leung, who really brings the character of Wenwu to life. One of the best - honestly, the best, Marvel villain to date. My only wish was that Michelle Yeoh had a bit more to do on screen.\",\n",

Every Characters performance was brilliant. I need to mention this because without this character the movie would not be that interesting and that role is played by Awkwafina as Katy. Her comic timing was so good. And as always marvel surprised me to have the villain as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as as Xu Wenwu.

              " 'Shang-Chi is 2.5 hours of your life well spent by basking in the glory of a compelling, profound story with absolutely breathtaking visuals. It\\'s so easy to get lost in the majesty of the world that\\'s being portrayed and to feel like this is your life for a short period. That being said, the movie is a double edged sword; not in terms of the movie itself, but rather the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole.Shang-Chi evokes a feeling that I\\'ve only experienced from two other Marvel movies: Black Panther and Dr. Strange. After 10+ years, the whole \"America will save the world\" and \"America is the center of everything\" vibe has grown dull. What these three films all have in common is that they do not focus on the \"America first\" mentality that has been the case with MCU films for so long. They make the universe in which these stories are taking place feel so much richer.The movie starts off with something that I cannot recall ever having been done in an MCU film before: dialogue that is not English. The Chinese dialogue with subtitles automatically makes you feel like this is something different, in the best way possible. What\\'s more, there are numerous instances across the film where characters speak Chinese, which makes the experience feel so much more culturally authentic.The fighting scenes are unlike anything seen in any other Marvel movie. There is a fluidity to the characters\\' movements which feels like dancing. These moments alone make the movie a must see.The special effects are beyond satisfying. The creatures based on Chinese legends look so lifelike that you genuinely feel like they could exist out in nature. The Great Protector in particular is jaw dropping and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time it\\'s on-screen. Furthermore, any moment involving the Ten Rings is pure visual delight.As for the story, a perfect balance is struck between a grounded human experience and an otherworldly mystical journey. The heartfelt family conflict moments are not the kind of cheesy stuff you usually get in a high budget superhero movie. You really feel for what the characters are going through and are genuinely concerned for their well-being. Furthermore, the otherworldly aspect of the story fits in perfectly with the aforementioned conflict. There are a lot of abstract concepts and creatures that wield strong mystical powers, and when you reach the end of the movie you might think to yourself \"I don\\'t really understand everything that I just saw\". However, that\\'s part of the beauty of this movie. It bridges whats familiar and easily understood with stuff that\\'s very unfamiliar and difficult to comprehend, which leaves you both satisfied and full of wonder.For the longtime MCU fans, Wenwu perfectly explains all the references of the Ten Times dating back to Iron Man 1 and how good organization worked. Trevor Slattery also makes an appearance and plays a pretty significant role in the film, which fulfills the longtime wish of Marvel fans to learn about his fate. His humorous role from Iron Man 3 is perfectly preserved, yet he\\'s also given purpose beyond simply being a joke character. The character is ultimately very satisfying and surpassed all expectations.I could keep going on and on about how great this movie is. It\\'s truly a Marvel masterpiece and deserves all the accolades it will inevitably receive.',\n",

I wasn't sure about the cast picked but after watching this and getting to know the characters portrayed they absolutely work. You know how the first Iron Man and Thor movies made you feel? This movie is like that. Not too many side plots, no going down the rabbit hole trying to keep up with this and that. This was a straight story line with great character building. While there is a ton of CGI I felt it wasn't overly done; it was used when needed and was not overbearing. I have to give props the Awkwafina, as well. She did a great job keeping up with the heavily driven scenes. She was still her funny self but she knew when to pull back on her signature funny schitck and played out the serious/low key scenes to perfection. This was a good role for her and I hope to see her in the next Shang-Chi movie.\",\n",

I like how much was in Chinese, it made it all so realistic. I'm happy Kate and Shang-Chi didn't end up together or anything, they are good best friends and there wasn't room for it.

Absolutely beautiful work of art. Plot points definitely were meant to set up action scenes, but that's what a fighting film is supposed to do. Some acting choices were a little off, but I'm willing to sacrifice that in order to have experienced fighters play the roles. Tony Leung crushed it, absolute standout. Simu Liu was a treasure. Awkwafina made in a blast. Michelle Yeoh and Fala Chen added an amazingly beautiful artistry and depth to the movie.\",\n",

It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.\",\n",

The main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of MCU, and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film. What many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth. But I'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the Shang Chi character, introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself. The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie. But they made every character unique, even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate. The fight sequences give goosebumps everytime I watch 'em. Can't wait for the sequel!!!\",\n",

I gave it a 10 because it was a stunning watch for us even at home and because IMO it's one of the top tier MCU films.\",\n",

I Was Really Proud that Niki and Rich Brian was in Shang Chi SoundtrackWhen Mandarin acting died I was really sad but when that little creature come to him, and mandarin was said \"it was acting, come on pretend to be die\" and that was so funnyThe Ending was look like Godzilla vs Kong maybe cause the monster and the monster was fighting and Shang chi weapon was so strong. And it\\'s kinda sad cause his dad die in front of Shang chi.This movie it doesn\\'t feels like 2 hours but it\\'s feels like 1 hours and I really really really wanna watch this movie again so bad.

Simu Liu is so passionate about this character and it really pays off. He brings a great performance, some of my favourite scenes are with him and Wenwu (Tony Leung) having an emotional mental battle. He was great!Katy Awkwafina usually annoys me in movies, but not so much in this one. She is actually quite funny a lot of the time (apart from the forced MCU humour) and delivered a good sidekick performance!Trevor Slattery\\nI loved having Trevor back. He was hilarious in this movie, and I love Ben Kingsleys portrayal of this character.Xialing\\nI thought she was pretty cool, it's cool to see what's happening with her going forward.Overall just a great movie, the colour grading in this movie is gorgeous too! The choreography is the best we've seen in the MCU thanks to Brad Simpson (RIP) and really feels authentic to the old Jackie movies.

Fighting scenes are interesting and fun by combining Asian and Western-style fights. The plot of the story is also classic but the audience actually feels sympathy for Wenwu. The appearance of the dragon and the fighting scene of the Dragon adds to the Asian impression in this film. You could say this is an Asian-flavored Marvel film. For actors, Tony Leung's acting is undoubtedly a colossal action senior.\",\n",

              " 'A brilliant blend of Chinese (Asian) culture and superhero storytelling infused \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" with a level of excellence and beauty, wonder and awe, that only such a film can capture.Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, this movie from Marvel was a lush planet of possibilities in their already gilded multi-verse. I enjoyed every second of this film, especially what each of its cast brought to it.Simu Liu as the titular Shang-Chi (alias Shaun) was outstanding in the lead role. He more than breathed life into this popular comic-book character. I truly appreciated the \\'less is more\\' approach to his performance.Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery and Awkwafina as Katy were both scene-stealers. A powerhouse support-performance came from Michelle Yeoh - I\\'ve been a huge fan of hers - who played Ying Nan.Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Xu Wenwu (the \\'big bad\\') was remarkable. Meng\\'er Zhang as Xialing was superb. So was Fala Chen as Li and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist. I also liked what Andy Le brought to his role as Death Dealer. Wong, played by Benedict Wong, made interesting cameos. The younger versions of Xialing and Shang-Chi - played by Elodie Fong and Jayden Zhang, respectively - were both good. Shang-Chi\\'s teen version played by Arnold Sun was also good.Screenplay by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton, and Andrew Lanham left no loose ends. The Mandarin inclusions added realism to the film\\'s characters. The writers took familiar and established Asian-movie storytelling techniques and gave it a Marvel-ian twist that I found enormously admirable.Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin were the original creators of this superb superhero, namely Shang-Chi, in Marvel canon. I\\'m sure they stand proud knowing what this movie has done to capture the spirit and resolve of their hero.Bill Pope\\'s cinematography and Joel P. West\\'s musical scoring were both significant drivers of credibility and entertainment for Disney+ Hotstar\\'s \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\". They both did an excellent job.Art direction and production design, as well as set decoration and stunts, and VFX/special effects/animation/CGI all did mighty good work on this project. Not a single frame felt \\'less than\\' or \\'just enough\\'. The crew in these departments certainly went out of their way to instil a \\'larger than life\\' sense with every choreograph and sequence in the movie.Costume design by Kym Barrett deserves special mention. She has done great work before on other notable titles. Her talents were more than perfect for \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" on Disney+ Hotstar. She balanced Asian flavour with signature Marvel style, a task not altogether simple.There is more going on in this deeply meaningful and potently symbolic movie than meets the eye. Such glorious Kung-Fu scenes as well. Fans are sure to enjoy everything that \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" has to offer. Don\\'t forget to watch that end-credits scene - it looks like we\\'re getting a sequel. There\\'s also a deleted scene available.To be honest, I have not read a single comic book featuring the titular hero, but I have heard of him. My first proper introduction to Shang-Chi was (technically) in this movie, and I must admit it drew me to appreciate and be inspired by the character on multiple levels.',\n",
              " \"Tony Leung elevates this movie to where it has no business being. As soon as the last shot of his last scene you feel the change in the atmosphere as the movie goes back to applying the same MCU formula we've all seen. It's fine if that's what you watch the movie for, but for other people like me I've seen enough of it to not still want more of the same. If Marvel movies were noodles, they all taste pretty much the same for me. But this one gives a special ingredient that you can't help notice make it so different from the other noodles in the menu. That ingredient is Tony Leung.Besides that, the story has considerably more depth than your usual Marvel movies. It touches the subject of families, and how they're important whether or not you like them.I'd be surprised if any Shang-Chi sequels would top this anytime soon. Tony Leung is one of a kind.\",\n",

The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting\\nThe plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more.

I love the Mandarin in this movie he was my favorite character in this movie besides, Morris, Morris is the best character ever. Morris is great. The Mandarin in this movie is one of my favorite Marvel villains ever. The Ten Rings are very interesting. The bus scene at the beginning is awesome. The opening scene was also quite good.

The action scenes are really cool and Simu Liu is great as Shang-Chi. I really like his character a lot and his acting is quite good. I really like the plot, it is simple but I really enjoyed it. Meng' er Zhang is good as Xialing as well. My biggest flaw is Awkwafina, she isn't as bad in this as she was in Raya and the Last Dragon and she is funny in this some of the time but I just don't think I like her very much.

Oh yeah, did I mention I'm 70 years old?\",\n",
              " \"Xu Wenwu might just be Marvel's best villain. He has done unforgivable things, but motives are entirely sympathetic. The movie does a great job of showing him as a human being and not just some agent of evil. Part of that is the writing, but a huge chunk of the credit goes to Tony Leung's performance.All of the performances are top-notch. Despite taking place in such a heightened reality, they all feel very grounded and human. The friendship and love between Shang-Chi and Katy in particular feels completely natural, especially in those scenes at her home in San Francisco.Hong Kong action films have a reputation for a kind of creativity that a lot of Hollywood films lack. Traditionally a Hollywood fight scene could change it's setting, or the people in it, and you wouldn't notice a difference, because they're planned without taking the character or environment into account. In Hong Kong action they use the character's clothes, everyday objects, parts of the environment, so that particular fight could only have taken place with those particular characters in those particular environments. Hollywood's gotten better at it over the years, and Shang-Chi is a wonderful example. You couldn't transplant that bus fight between Shang-Chi and Razorfist onto a dock, or swap out Razorfist for Bushwacker. They also go all-in on the balletic Wuxia style fight choreography, with water and leaves and other elements of the environment flowing along with the fighter's movements.Like all MCU films, it drags a bit in the tail end with it's very long battle filled with CGi performances. The use of large empty arenas - the gate platform, the lake, the sky - makes it feel a little less grounded, and a little more Hollywood than the other battle scenes. It would have been nice for them to have some more distinct features for the characters to interact with - statuary like the story wall shown earlier in the film, for example. An especially wasted opportunity for the parts of the battle taking place in the village, which was full of architecture and decoration that could have been put to creative use. But there's still enough quality fight choreography to keep you interested.There's also a couple of fun post-credits sequences - I was already all-in on any Shang-Chi sequels, but these were wonderful teasers for what may be coming.\",\n",

They're given two pendants but their mother as we discover that she was killed and her father took up the 10 Rings again.We then discover a grown up Shang-Chi (Or Shaun as he is now known) living in San Francisco as a car valet with his friend Katy (played brilliantly by the actress Awkwafina). As they're travelling to work on a bus henchmen sent by his father attack him. What follows is a very well choreographed fight seen and lots of destruction.Realising the pendent has been stolen by the henchmen Shaun races back home to his apartment to grab clothes for a flight to Macau. To try and save his sister from losing her pendent.Not wishing to miss out, Katy insists on joining Shaun for the ride. On the flight over Shaun explains he is not the man who Katy thought he was and explains his past.When he arrives in Macau he goes to the address on a postcard which he assumed was sent by his sister. It turns out his sister runs an illegal fight club where huge amounts of betting takes place inside and online.Shaun is already well known thanks to a YouTube video of his exploits in San Francisco going viral. He also finds out he is going to be the main attraction and lots of money has already been bet on him.A fight is already going on and a familiar face is taking part. I will not spoil that bit for you. As he goes into the ring the opponent appears and it turns out to be his sister.Chaos then ensues as the same henchmen have arrived at the illegal fighting den after the second pendent. The fight scenes which take place on scaffolding between Shaun, his sister and his fathers henchmen are breath taking and it really makes you feel as though you're high up on the side of a building.They're eventually captured and taken back to their former home. When it is explained that their dad hears their mum calling to him and he believes she is still alive but being kept captive by the elders in Tao-Lo. He must go and find Tao-Lo but can only find the correct path once a year and that time is soon.Meanwhile he locks all 3 up in a dungeon as they will not help him go and find their mother. What follows is absolutely hilarious as an old character from the Iron Man franchise makes an appearance.While they're in the dungeon they're introduced to a creature from Tao-Lo called Morris and they find out from this creature that there is a much quicker way to get to Tao-Lo. So, stealing a car, they head to the lost village.Upon arriving they meet their Aunt who is also mourning the loss of her sister. They are told about and ancient evil that eats souls and many cities fell to it and was only defeated by the help of a dragon. Shang Chi and Xialing are given dragon scale armor (a gift from their mother). Katy trains with a bow and arrow and Shaun trains with his aunt to learn the dragon magic fighting style.The 10 Rings then attack the village with Shaun fighting his father first on the side of the lake which he is then sent crashing into. While unconscious under water he learns his power can call the guardian dragon.Meanwhile at the entrance of the of the cave where his father believes his mother is calling from. His father can be seen trying to break into the cave. Which eventually releases bat like creatures that suck up the souls of individuals.Continuing to try and release his wife. Wenwu releases the mother of all beasts and a battle ensues. Sadly we see Wenwu killed as his soul is sucked out by one of the bat like creatures. But, not before himself and Shaun battle it out against each other. Upon his death, the 10 Rings are passed on to Shaun. The battle comes to an end and the villagers mourn the loss of those lost in battle.We then get taken back to San Francisco where Shaun and Katy are telling their story to two friends who look at them as though they're going mad and in fact one complains that she is having the mickey taken out of her.The closing scene sees a popular character appear and both Shaun and Katy follow them. Which gives a clue I suspect as to how phase 4 will pan out in the future of the MCU.There are two closing credit scenes. One where we find both Shaun and Katy in a building and other Marvel characters have appeared. Again, this shows where the MCU is going.The second involves his sister.. but that is all I will reveal as this will also show what I think is going to be the direction of the MCU.There are little snippets within the film that also mention past events. Can you hear and find them?Overall this is a brilliant film! Some very good special effects. The music score is good. Some very funny characters too. I think this is a very good start to Phase 4 and miles better than Black Widow.As my title suggests please ignore the 1 * reviews on here. I suspect they're DC fans in disguise trying to make MCU look bad. But, by all means read them and make up your own mind by going to watch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I don't think you'll be disappointed.\",\n",
              " 'Great movie! I enjoyed it very much!Updates: Only mentioned the bad sides from my previous review. Let me put some good side here:\\nThe fightings are really good! Best among all the marvel movies! A lot of long takes, really entertaining! When auntie tried to teach ShangChi, you can feel how the fighting turns from a very heavy, hard-core one into a more gentle but even powerful one. It\\'s about cultivating the enemy\\'s force by turning the direction of the enemy\\'s fist. It\\'s also the power we believe that water has: overcome the strong by applying some soft and gentle methods. Interestingly, Wong used that trick in his battle too. [BTW: when that guy took out two knives, I thought it was Loki. Can we let Loki fight with more magics? If it burns money for special effects, can we have at least some teleport tricks pls pls pls? TAT]The animal CGs are really cool! You know these animals were Phoenix, Nine-tailed fox, Kirins without saying it.some details about WenWu:1. I don\\'t think Wenwu was being sexist to his daughter. 1000 years ago, society was generally sexist. However, when he got defeated by her wife, he showed admiration instead of being angry. It means he accepted the fact. And when the kids were young, the whole family trained together. But after Ying Li died, he stopped her training, but still, he didn\\'t send her to learn some \"female\" stuff as the stereotypes. I think it was because Lingling reminds him of his wife, and he was trying to escape from what happened.2. Wenwu trained ShangChi not entirely for revenge. He told ShangChi when he was young, that he would like to give the ten rings if he grows strong enough. I was confused at first: why Wenwu did not seek revenge himself but told ShangChi to. Then I realized, ShangChi was there seeing her mother fight till death to protect him and his sister. Wenwu wanted ShangChi to have the power to protect himself and her sister. Wenwu made a \"mistake\" when he release the bad guys, which lead to Ying li\\'s death. So he wanted to teach ShangChi not to make the same \"mistake\" again. He still cares about his children, but not in a way people understand, not even ShangChi and LingLing could understand.3. Wenwu put incense in front of Ying li\\'s photo, so he knew deep inside that she was dead. But he was running away from the fact. He thought he was so powerless, that he couldn\\'t do anything to stop her from death. He couldn\\'t make something up for her.======================================================Some suggested changes I am thinking: Maybe when Guangbo got caught by the birds, Katy could take several shots but missed because she hurried to save him so was not able to calm down to aim. But then, she found there is only one arrow remaining, so she calms down and reminds the line auntie Ying Nan said (if she could explain to her in both languages would be better), and make the great shot at the evil dragon.Also, in the end, I think it would be better if the good dragon is not lying on the ground resting and letting the two kids drop. We believe water is the source of the dragon, and the dragon also represents kings, royals, etc. It would be great if the scene was like the dragon dropping them down while standing still in the water and dropping them using its body, and throwing them to the tail to land these kids. Then quickly go back into the lake(actually dragons live in the sea but I think any water is fine).BTW: the only downside I see as a Chinese viewer: The Chinese lines from Google translation sucks. You can understand, but it\\'s not the words you will say in daily life if you wanna express the same thing. Maybe same as the paragraphs I just wrote above. XDD.',\n",

Jokes occupy most of newer marvel movies even endgame falls victim to this. But this movie is different there are joked but they are placed well. Characters won't joke between fights or between emotional heavy hitting scenes and boy the action in this movie its captivating to say the least. The dynamic between Shang chi and his father is awesome. You sympathize with both Shang chi and his father. Marvel feels like old school marvel this time.

There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen.

While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness.

My main worry was awkwafina because I really can't stand her as an actress but man she was GREAT in this. Everyone was pretty great honestly.

I am beginning to tire of Chinese action sequences because they seem so much of the same but this movie has fresh stuff. The best part for me after the action scenes was Wong, drunk on his ass, singing karaoke to Hotel California. Hysterical. The \"friend\"/girlfriend in the movie is really superb-so fresh and refreshing as \"the babe\". She was good. To be honest, the movie reminded me of a Broadway play that needed another week or two of shakedown yet it still clicked in enough places that you know you\\'ve got something. The family scenes early on in the movie are nice and humanizing. It\\'s got a few rough spots; the rest is good to very good.

I can't really sympathy with him. The sidekicks in this story have more interesting background or personality (for ex.

Basically just a powerful guy losing mind for his beautiful wife. Shangchi himself has a funny character as well. So it's become a popcorn movie but still deep with emotions. Best marvel movie since the winter soliderThe only little regret for me is simu Liu's outlook. Man the face only deserves parking cars. I know Jackie Chan is also not good looking but shangchi to me is very handsome guy whose face is at least at the level of Donnie yen. Come on, he's a comic book super hero.It's already making history by breaking record of Labor Day sales of ANY movie, and it's three times more. Actually this movie is very hard to fail.

A superb cast good enough that even Michelle Yeoh's usual outstanding performance didn't upstage everyone else. Beautiful visuals like you'd expect from some of the better recent chinese films rather than a Marvel film. And the action and visual effects didn't disappoint.Well worth seeing on the big screen to truly appreciate.\",\n",
              " \"The first film in the MCU's next phase was BLACK WIDOW, but that film, which featured Scarlet Johannson's swan song as the title character, felt very much like it was grounded in what had come before, but SHANG-CHI: THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS very much breaks new ground, and takes us into a heretofore only hinted at corner of the Marvel Universe. It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.Like all origin movies, SHANG-CHI begins with some exposition and back story, specifically concerning his father, Wenwu, played by Tone Leung, a power hungry thousand year old immortal, who wields the Ten Rings of the title, a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source. Only when he meets Li, played by Fala Chen, a fighter from the hidden realm of Ta-Lo, does he find someone who is his equal in combat. Falling in love, Wenwu forsakes his violent ways, and starts a family with Li. But in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy, and when Li is murdered by Wenwu's rivals, he seeks vengeance, becoming the villain he once was, and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins. When we meet Shang-Chi, well played by Simu Liu, he is a twenty something Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend, Katy, played by Awkwafina, having broken from his father's world. But as with most stories centering on estranged families, the plot turns on them being drawn back together, and Wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to Shang-Chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential, he believes, if he is to free his deceased spouse from the Dark Realm, whose entrance lies inside Ta-Lo. And if Shang-Chi doesn't want to go along with Dad's plan, too bad. It all comes to a head in an epic battle in Ta-Lo in a CGI heavy third act - pretty much a staple for the MCU.I liked this movie because it has plenty of energy, with great well done action scenes, along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles. It also has a lot of heart, with characters who are easy to become invested in. And this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. In Tony Leung, it has a great villain with an understandable motive, something essential with any good super hero film. Simu Liu is an appealing lead, and he's matched all the way by Awkwafina's Katy, an underachiever who discovers special skills. I am not always impressed with CGI laden film making, but I don't mind it here because I actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action. The finale in Ta-Lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie, but for me, nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of San Francisco early in the film, where Shang-Chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions, led by the fearsome Razor Fist, played by the physically impressive Florian Monteneau. Michelle Yeoh has a part as a village elder, and out of nowhere, Ben Kingsley returns as actor Trevor Slattery, thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from IRON MAN 3.An early scene at a Hong Kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the MCU with appearances by Benedict Wong's character from DOCTOR STRANGE, and the Abomination from THE HULK. Wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up Shang-Chi and Katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the MCU. Will they learn where the Ten Rings came from, and maybe does THE ETERNALS have anything to do with it? And there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when Shang-Chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father. Something tells me we will find out in some future installment. I can hardly wait.\",\n",

Michelle Yeoh (still friggin awesome and butt-kicking at 59 years-old) is even playing in both movies.There\\'s pretty colors, fantastical elements, comedy elements... but under everything, there\\'s a cool story of revenge, of abandonment, of murder, of family and grief. Well, it\\'s a great Kung-Fu movie, not a formulaic super-hero movie.Simu Liu is really charismatic and the fight scenes are awesome (some still sucks, though, because of too much CGI).The actress that plays Shang-Chi\\'s sister is great too and I hope we see her in more movies.Well, everybody is fantastic in the movie (especially Ben Kingsley).It\\'s been a while that I didn\\'t loved a Marvel movie so much and it gives me some optimism on what can still happen with the MCU.',\n",

I felt the amount of comedy was just right with Ben Kingsley smashing it again as Trevor - superb.

              " 'It\\'s a story about love, have courage to respond to your calling, and letting go. Great acting and the whole package of the whole movie is awesomely done. Though I don\\'t think the marketing of the film is good, for almost zero campaign regarding this film is seen prior it debute. Another thing worth mention is Chinese people just won\\'t fight or even threaten to \"kill\" his/her parent, not to mention to even fight in front of parent\\'s tomb. Marvel could have avoid the fighting thing in the shrine, since Chinese culture just won\\'t allow anything disrespectful the ancestors at all.The story line of wenwu(Tony Leung), his character and his love towards his son and daughter is obvious, and Leung did a great job acting as a Chinese stubborn strict father who\\'s afraid his legacy will be lost and desperately want to build an empire to conquer all. He loved his son and let his son do whatever he wanted for ten years. And though he had it all, wenwu realized he can never get over his wife and he wanted to see her so badly, he became delusional and knowing it\\'s not possible but still wanted to break the gate in Talo.The story of why Webwu is like this is solid. But shangchi wise, is not. The movie would be better if shangchi showed a bit of affection towards wenwu and his sister. Also, in ancient Chinese society, women often has to learn to play music, sewing, or painting and play chess. Shangchi\\'s sister could have done other stuff, rather than peeping aside and not being able to learn anything in her childhood, since Wenwu supposed to love her as well. In regards of wenwu\\'s power and money, it shouldn\\'t be hard to find his offsprings proper tutor.CGI wise is intriguing, you will see some characters from ancient Chinese Shan hai jing.

Throughout the whole movie the conflict between father and son is at the forefront and is the real emotional driving force of the story. And what a great idea for a superhero movie to tackle such a deep and relatable topic.There is even an important line of foreshadowing by Shang, the evening before the final battle: -I'm going to kill my father-. What a strong statement and what a setup.But then the climax of the movie turns out the be a fight between 2 dragons.. the father dies by pure bad luck couple of scenes earlier.. killed by a random monster.A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf they had kept the emotional conflict and the father&son dynamic as the climax of the movie, it COULD have become a masterpiece, which would have been more then just a great super-hero movie, it would have become timeless.HERE'S MY PITCH FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES:1) the father tries to open the gate. Shang-Chi fights him. Shang gradually wins the upper hand in the battle as he taps into his mothers skills.The father doesn't give in and continuously tries to open the gate. -If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me- he yells. Now Shang-Chi is confronted with the moral dilemma of choosing to save the world or the life of his father.2) Shang-Chi choses to defeat his father, however he doesn't kill him just wounds him badly and takes the rings off him.It is too late however, the gate has Already opened and the monster comes through and goes straight for the village3) The father realizes his mistake and has a moment of emotional breakthrough as he realizes his wrongdoings and how he has let his son down as a father. He asks for forgiveness. They exchange a few deep words before Shang rushes off.4) with the help of the rings and the village dragon Shang-Chi manages to defeat the Monster.5) The gate is still open and it needs to be closed. It gets established that closing it also kills the person who does so.6) Shang doesn't hesitate for a second and rushes to the gate to sacrifice himself. Just before getting there his father pushes him out of the way and closes the gate in his stead. He dies saving his son and everyone else and redeems himself and ultimately heals the broken bond he had with his son....aaaaand scene.Now THAT in my eyes would be a worthy arc for the father and emotional climax which pays off the great build up the movie does.\",\n",

They were all likable, and badass in their own way. And you could empathize with them. I thought this was a very strong villain. Not just physically, but very compelling. A lot of MCU villains can come across as very one note. But he was complex and layered. So that was great to see. And of course they were all strongly acted as well. Akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (Check out The Farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like, she is still is good in this.I loved the fight choreography in this. Probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the MCU. And I loved the visuals used in those scenes as well. Some shots were truly stunning to watch.One downside I had though is that I wanted to know more about how the magic works. Like the final battle between Shang Chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting. And I know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having Shang Chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training. But seriously, how did that happen? Is it just because he's his mother's son? Is it because he was specifically in that place? I just needed a little more backstory/explanation. Also, the Wong/Abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions. I guess they needed a way to set up Wong for the mid credits scene though. And that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me. Like why is Bruce back to being in his human form? It clearly takes place after the events of Endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his Professor Hulk form?I thought the comedy was good for the most part. I think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film. But didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film.

The amount of action was typical of Marvel\\'s style and was certainly overdone at the start when the plot could have moved along a little faster, but there were also moments where you were simply allowed to breathe.They took the time to show character interactions that made people\\'s bonds with one another believable and made me care about Awkwafina\\'s character. Katy had almost none of Marvel\\'s standard comic-relief character flaws and instead had mostly delightful interactions with Shang, there were gorgeously slowed down scenes that showed the more peaceful flow of movement of the Ta Lo people, and finally, the story was told cyclically with constant breaks back into flashbacks, rather than linearly. This less formulaic approach to storytelling left a lasting impression on me.One flaw (according to me): the instigator of the conflict is a situation in which the father can be duped by a mere voice, which is not entirely credible given that he has lived for over a thousand years and would have had to be smarter than that to have survived this long. If his grief over his wife\\'s death had been more recent, it would have been more convincing as a motivator for his lack of critical thinking.I won\\'t go into too many more details. Overall, this is a very good film. It may not be everyone\\'s cup of tea, but as someone who enjoys Eastern media for its emphasis on character interactions, familial/friend love, cyclical storytelling, and, on occasion, complex solutions to problems, this was a nice homage to that.',\n",

This movie does both perfectly, within the first 30 minutes we are drawn to Shang as a character and that lasts throughout the entire movie.

The cinematography is spot on with plenty of slow motion which is just as well because the speed these guys move is phenomenal and breath-taking at times.

The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie.',\n",

Not because of the narrative which is pretty normal, nor the performance which is somewhat above average, it is impressive for the proper use of elements from Chinese myth.When the crew arrived the hidden Talo village, it is such wow! The mythical animals are exactly what I image them to be, the Long(dragon), Feng (fire bird), Kirin, Nine tail fox. It feels like they just came out of the Chinese mythical stories that passed down from generation to generation.And the Kong-fu too! The use of Tai-chi movement is smart, combining with the natural magic, the visual presentation is great! It is definitely a good movie for Kong-fu fans.The narrative is not bad, the legendary villain gave up everything for a beautiful girl, they lived happy life until his wife was killed during his enemy's vengeance. The miss of his wife led him to break the portal that blocks powerful alien monster. His son, inherited the power from both him and his wife, found his way to defeat the villain and the monster. The world turns to peace once again!Overall, 7 star for the narrative and performance, 1 additional star for the Kongfu and another for the mythical elements, absolutely love those animals!\",\n",
              " 'Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin\\'s \"Special Marvel Edition # 15\" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre\\'s boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of \"Avengers Endgame\", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered\\nThe protagonist\\'s arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn\\'t been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of \"grays\" very well. In a franchise that is \"infantilized\" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel\\'s most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character\\'s leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films.

This is most likely because supervising stunt coordinator, Brad Allan (which the movie dedicated to) was a member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. The train fight scene may be one of the best of the MCU. In fact, a similar fight happened in Captain Marvel but it couldn't top this.Disliked:\\nKaty doesn't have a good backstory. The fact that she just hangs around with her best friend, travelling around Macao then Wen Wu's fortress and to Ta Lo. Later in third act was then be able to shoot an arrow right on the dweller's throat. The writers could've simply mention her archery or something related to her backstory so that her skills would make more sense.The CGI final battle between the Great Protector and the dweller was way over the top and obscured by thick grey fog.

This film is massive fun, massive action and has massive heart. The action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good. I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun. This is a good way to do an origin film this far into the MCU, it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick. Shang-chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy I think he will become a household name. The shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing Chinese settings. Some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all.

A great movie to watch with your family, but it's also great for marvel fans. Maybe one of the best marvel superhero origin stories. The pacing is decent, and the visuals are phenomenal. And you'll be happy with all the little easter eggs and extras. This is a very fun movie, it's not too dark, and i can recommend this for every marvel fan out there, it's definitely worth the watch.

It was awesome at the start, but it seemed to drag out a bit too long. Still very entertaining though. Even if you're not a Marvel fan, I still highly recommend seeing this film.

Going in to this movie I honestly expected to dislike it given how predictable marvels films have gotten and generally suffering from Marvel bloat but Shang Chi surpassed my expectations and gave me two hours of awesomeness.

As Marvel's first Asian led superhero movie, it amazingly depicts the story of a young man trying to become someone who is completely different than his father and fits well with the movie's heritage of the mandarin. The introduction of the ten rings bring a bold new perspective of the weapon from the comics and becomes one of the best powers to have in the MCU. It is a standard superhero film as there is a huge CGI battel at the end, but nonetheless done beautifully.

That built up and exceled when the super hero fighting took place as well, it was just fighting perfection for me.The soundtrack of this movie was off the charts, starting from the opening scene, to the train fight scene and throughout.Now the visuals... they were... stunning.Humour was well placed and got a giggle or two out of the whole cinema, especially with Trevor, hahah.If it had just a biiiiiit of more depth in the story it would be a 10/10.',\n",

              " \"Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings\\n2021\\n12A\\ndirector: Destin Daniel Cretton\\nstarring: Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Ben Kingsley, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Michelle Yeoh, Wah Yeun, Florian Munteanu etcShang Chi (Simu Liu) the master of unarmed weaponry-based kung fu. Is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organisation. Wow what a film Shang Chi was and one of the strongest additions to the MCU.My first few positives would be the character background and set up. As well as the fantastic cinematography, worldbuilding and action. As well as the likeable characters and performances. I really liked that the film went into the character background for the Mandarin and the mythology of the ten rings and how he got them, with an action packed and well explained opening sequence that set the tone for the film very well, offering something different from the MCU from the very first scene. I also thought the set up was strong, the film established Shang Chi and his life without his dad excellently, making you connect to the characters, but also did a great job at setting up the villain's intentions well and developing the plot nicely. The cinematography in this film had to be some of the most beautiful visuals I have seen from the MCU. There were so many beautifully shot scenes especially within the action scenes with mid or long shots where you could actually see what was happening. The colour grading and scope of the film was seriously impressive, I was in awe. I also thought the action was probably the strongest I have seen from the MCU. The action was incredibly choreographed, very entertaining, and incorporated Asian culture and kung fu and they were so well shot it was one of the films strongest elements. The worldbuilding was also very strong. This film introduced us to such a rich and beautiful new world, it was beautiful and well explained and really explored in a lot of detail but left more to be explored for the future. This film was like seeing Wakanda for the first time. The film had such likeable characters. Particularly with Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) all of the new characters introduced were instantly likeable and I connected with them quickly. This was also helped by the fantastic Chemistry between the whole cast, everyone worked amazing together, especially Simu Liu and Awkwafina who were both amazing here, and did amazing performances. They both had loads of charm and charisma. Other cast standouts were Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh and Menger Zhang.My next few positives would be the humour and sound design. The family dynamic and character depth. As well as the fun cameos and Plot twists. The soundtrack for the film was also excellent, it gave the action scenes in particular an intense atmosphere and really elevated a lot of the scenes well. I really liked the family dynamic the film had. Having the villain be Shang Chi's father and his mother and sister be involved was a great idea. It made the film more personal to the characters and increased the stakes for the characters, they had a connection and the conflict between the different members of the family was very well written. This gave characters like Shang Chi and the Mandarin a lot more character depth. The mandarin was so crushed by his wife's death because she made him a good man, and his quest to find his wife really gave him some emotional depth, and Shang Chi's attempt to live a normal life and escape his father's shadow, but also look for his dads love and acceptance was really well handled, as well as his character decisions involving his sister and his regret over his mother gave his character a good amount of layers. The cameos in this film were a lot of fun, there was a few easter eggs sprinkled throughout but it still felt like its own film. But having Wong back was a great surprise and that was in the trailer so not a spoiler. I also thought the plot twists were strong. The twists involving the family's secrets and the new world were well executed, unexpected and added some great layers to the film, it never once got boring.I did have a few minor issues. The villain was underused going into the final act, there was a few issues with the creative decisions in the final act. And there was a slight overusage of flashbacks. I did find that the mandarin was taken out of a big chunk of the film in order to delay the final act and expand the story world more, it would have been nice for his character to be incorporated within the plot as a whole instead of being used for more flashbacks. I did find that there were too many flashbacks. A lot of them served the plot well and had purpose, but some of them felt unneeded and repetitive and were occasionally jarring. There were just a few creative decisions in the final act I wasn't fond of. There was some overusage of CGI that took me out of a couple of scenes, and there was a deux ex Machina with Katy that was slightly cheesy to me.My final few positives would be the set pieces. Great development to the plot and balance to the villain. As well as interesting elements, great dialogue, and a great final act. The films set locations were beautiful, they really captured the magic of the world as well as Asian culture, the representation for the Asian community in this film was excellent. The plot development was also excellent, the twists gave the film multiple layers to work with, and the different acts flowed well, with constant new elements being added to keep the film feeling fresh. I also thought the film did an excellent job at making the audience sympathise with the Mandarin but also making it clear he was still the villain, as the film showed what kind of man he used to be with his wife I understood him wanting to be reunited with her, but the film excellently balanced this with his cruel and controlling behaviour to make him one of the strongest villains I have seen in a while in the MCU. I also thought there was a lot of interesting elements to the story world. The world of Ta lo was fascinating, and the film went into great detail of the culture and the lives of the people living there which was fascinating. The dialogue was also great, raising great themes of acceptance, family and grief that was excellently told through the lines of dialogue that felt personal to the characters and were very well written. The final act was also amazing. They went all out with the visuals and action. In a thrilling, exciting and breath-taking final act that conclude the story and the character arcs excellently and setting up Chang Chi's future in the MCU very well.Overall, Shang Chi has a few structure issues and falls into some MCU tropes with the CGI in the final act. But this film was visually stunning, with some of the best worldbuilding and action from the MCU. With star making performances from Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Also, with amazing Asian representation. This has really taken the MCU in a different direction and is one of their strongest origin stories.Overall rating 92/100.\",\n",
              " \"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were really strong. I liked the fight scenes. It's about time Marvel had some martial arts with an Asian background in it. The plot was good and seemed to flow well. The humour was good. They tied it in well with some post endgame comments and hidden things in the background. I really hope they continue with this movie and possibly a new Avengers movie. The only parts I didn't like were minor and it's toward the end, but I'm not spoiling it. It is definitely worth watching though. I want to watch again.\",\n",

              " 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest comic-book inspired action-fantasy film from Marvel-Disney Studios. Daniel Destin Crettin is the director.The film stars Simu Liu (Canadian television\\'s \"Kim\\'s Convenience\") as the title character. Known as Shaun in the beginning of the narrative, he\\'s a late-20-something who works as a valet at a San Francisco hotel with his carefree best friend Katy (Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum). Seemingly okay with eking by earning a working-class living, Shaun\\'s life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard. The next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus, forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess.Turns out, \"Shaun\" was born to Wenwu (veteran Chinese cinema star Tony Leung), a crime boss in China whose career has literally lasted centuries, thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers-- including, apparently, immortality. Shang Chi\\'s mother Ying Li (Fala Chen) was a resident of a mysterious, magical Chinese city-- think Shangri-La or Black Panther\\'s Wakanda. Possessing her own magic-inspired martial arts skills, she convinced Wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family. It didn\\'t last, leading to a family tragedy and Shang\\'s self-imposed exile in America.The plot has to do with Wenwu\\'s insistence on bringing Shang and his sister Xialing (Menger Zhang) back into the family fold, so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city, conquer the inhabitants and reunite with Ying Li, who Wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave. Shang and Xialing want nothing to do with their father\\'s criminal empire, but Wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation.The film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material. Part of this is legally necessary, as the comic book Shang Chi\\'s father was originally Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu-- officially owned by the Sax Rohmer estate. Additionally, the original comics posed Shang as an agent of Great Britain\\'s MI-6, with a mostly British supporting cast, including someone who \"playfully\" would refer to Shang as (an ethnic slur for Chinese/Asians). All of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries. Katy provides comic relief and as a low-key audience stand-in. As a 2nd-generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very \"Americanized\" who bristles at \"old school values and customs\" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life.Simu Liu gives a solid journeyman\\'s performance as Shang Chi. He handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components. Still, it\\'s something of a role that\\'s semi-mired in exposition, because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks.The action is well choreographed, including ballet-like scenes of combat and courtship alike, with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish. The film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of Bill Pope (his cinematography credits include \\'The Matrix\\' and the first three \\'Spider-Man\\' films).Possibly the most fully realized performance is that of Tony Leung, who gets to portray a more in-depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies. There are other solid supporting roles played by Michelle Yeoh and Sir Ben Kingsley.The climax of the film is filled with special-effects-based wonders including creatures of all sorts and Mulan-style fights between army legions. This can get dizzying for the non-comics-steeped layperson, so this may be overwhelming for some viewers. But the overall narrative is satisfying.The film takes place independent of any particular goings-in in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it is only a post-credits coda that links it to the greater Marvel pantheon. This film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the \"Avengers\" franchises.It remains to be seen whether \"Legend of the Ten Rings\" makes the Shang Chi character a household name alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the Rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the Marvel movie saga.',\n",
              " \"Absolutely loved it. IMO, it's the best MCU movie and that's saying a LOT, coming from me. It's original, has a great story, good screenplay, excellent fight scenes WITH the actors (not stuntmen), the villain has a unique agenda (not just to kill the hero or take over the world), the origin story is told perfectly, the superpower (the rings) is really interesting, and the music is fantastic. It finally bumped Iron Man down to #2 on my MCU list.\",\n",

The fight scenes were fantastic along with the other action sequences. Most of the characters were easy to sympathize with and the cameos were great.The only thing I personally felt that didn't go over very well was Aquifina's performance and comedic lines. It felt a little flat and I thought Ben Kingsley was way more funny than her. If it wasn't for the fact she shot the evil soul sucker in the throat saving Shang Chi and his sister, you could have left her out or played her character without all of the comedic misses and it would have been fine.As mentioned however my son and liked the movie and it provided a nice lead in to the next big bad guy of the MCU (maybe Mephisto?).

              " 'Masaki Kobayashi was a pacifist. The celebrated Japanese filmmaker, best-known for \"The Human Condition\", took the unusual and daring position of denouncing his country\\'s military actions during WWII. Somehow, Kobayashi got \"The Thick-Walled Room\" financed, and pushed it past the censors, even though it broached the largely taboo subject of war crimes. Set in an American detention center, war veterans express guilt and remorse, and most importantly, hold themselves accountable for their actions. \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", directed by Dustin Daniel Cretton, is evocative of Kobayashi\\'s ideology circumlocutorily by referencing \"Kwaidan\", in particular, \"The Woman of the Snow\", the second in a quartet of ghost stories, which was the filmmaker\\'s only foray into genre; the horror movie. Xu Wenwen(Tony Leung), aka \"The Mandarin\", a warmonger blessed with everlasting life, learns the whereabouts of Ta Lo, a village secreted away behind thick foliage. It\\'s people know how to fight like gods. Surviving the ambulatory trees that claim the Xu\\'s discovery party, he encounters Li(Fala Chen), the divine martial arts\\' most experienced practitioner, his future wife, in what can only be described as a grindhouse meet-cute. Whereas The Mandarin harnesses his power through the ten rings, Li only needs her bare hands to win the battle with relative ease. Without the ten rings(nunchucks being its closest analogue), The Mandarin is no Bruce Lee, whose hands they say, as the legend goes, were unregistered lethal weapons. Inexplicably, Li falls in love with this psychopath, whose penchant for violence rivals The Joker.From \"Kwaidan\", for starters, the filmmaker, having the advantage of CGI in his tool kit, draws out the plant life\\'s malevolent subtext, in which its lunging movement towards the two woodcutters, caught in a terrible snowstorm, seems not only a condition of the wild winds, but an innate cognition to do them bodily harm. The trees are sitting ducks. The trees can\\'t defend themselves from the woodcutters\\' axes. They\\'re lives are dependent on the Woman of the Snow, a glacial apparition whose arctic breath entombs men in ice. The \"Yuki-Onna\"(Keiko Kishi) blows on Mosaku(Jun Hamamura), one of the woodcutters, as he sleeps in an abandoned hut. It\\'s a superpower that any villain in the Marvel universe would regard with a modicum of awe. The surviving woodcutter witnesses the older man\\'s killing and expects the same ignominious end-result. But when the woman gets a closer look at Minokichi(Tatsuya Nakadai), she is smitten, indicated by an elusive smile, and ends up citing his handsomeness and youth as reasons for her charity. Clearly, the woman of the snow is lonely, her Achilles heel; the ultimate cougar, who must be at least a thousand-plus years his senior. In \"Shang Chi\", it\\'s more clear-cut that Li is abdicating her duty to defend Ta Lo from potential marauders, choosing personal happiness over communal obligation. Harder to glean, but not too hard, Yuki-Onna also has deep-seated commitments. A sort of Mother Nature, but militant, her job is to fend off those who wish to shorten the lives of flora and fauna; she\\'s a warrior for the natural world. Trees will fell unchallenged by the axes of future woodcutters, similar to how the Tai Lo villagers die in war waged by Wen-Wu and his army. Each respective woman chose love over duty; a domestic life, husband and children, over their calling.To both Shang Chi(Simu Liu) and Xialing(Meng-er Zhang), son and daughter, Li bequeaths her sired ones a green emerald pendant that even through adulthood, never leave their necks; these precious gemstones handed down from their deceased mother, refashioned into bling. Green, coincidence or not, is the same color as the crystal which guides young Clark Kent(Jeff East) to the farthest reaches of the north, in Richard Lester\\'s \"Superman\", where the Krypton-based jewel initiates construction on the Fortress of Solitude, Superman\\'s man cave. Both women, Li and Yuki-Onna inhabited fortress solitudes of their own, a village cut off from mainland China and rural Japan, respectively. Even Superman chooses Lois Lane(Margot Kidder) over being earth\\'s champion, when he exposes himself to the red sunlight of his home planet, which strips him of his superpowers. Nobody wants to be alone, not even the Man of Steel. Quite understandably, Li, being a responsible custodian, leaves her magic back in Tai Lo, not even trusting her husband with god-level Kung Fu. The ten rings, on the other hand, could be put to good use, but reappropriating the weapon into a tool to protect mankind isn\\'t in his nature. All he can do is store them away in a desk drawer, neutralizing its awesome power, in the interim. The Mandarin could be a potential superhero, but his reformation is conditional; it\\'s contingent on romantic love, not brotherly love. There are limits to love. He can only be a retired foe to earth, not its friend. Because of this, Li keeps secret from her husband the purport of those emeralds, which are actually emblematic eyes of a mechanized statue, not mere heirlooms passed down from parent to child, in which its niche as performative dragon eyes radiate water held in suspension long enough to yield a map that directs The Mandarin to Tai Lo. The mother played no favorites, whereas Jor-El(Marlon Brando) provided no duplicate green crystal for Kara(Helen Slater), Superman\\'s female cousin, in Jeannot Szwarc\\'s \"Supergirl\". Ta Lo is a country within a country. Growing up without a mother, Xialing, saddled with a father who abided by the unyielding tradition of China\\'s patriarchal strictures put on women, she could just watch in secrecy as Shang-Chi, training to be an assassin, fought alongside the men; a boy among men, shadowing his every move. That\\'s China. As the forgotten daughter, waiting for her father to show up, Jiang Nan(Michelle Yeoh), to Xiangling\\'s surprise, is informed that men and women train and fight like egalitarians. That\\'s not China; that\\'s a Chinese utopia. Shang-Li, previously attacked stateside, in which his cover as a underachiever is blown, when the car valet reveals himself to be Bruce Lee incarnate on a moving bus, to the amazement of Katy(Awkwafina), his childhood friend, disposing all-comers with exceptional ease. Under attack again, this time in his home country, once again he faces the same gang, this time, joined by Xiangling, at a fight club, an enterprise she built from scratch, it goes unsaid, to earn her father\\'s love after leaving home as a lost sixteen-year-old girl. Just as Shang-Li is about to put the finishing touch on his old trainer, identifiable by a fancy yellow and black mask. The father uses the ten rings to stop Shang-Chi. It\\'s a strange reunion. With paternal love, Mandarin admits that he put a hit on Shang-Chi. But like a proud papa, he knew that his assassin training would, more likely than not, stave off annihilation, and is overjoyed that he was right. Nothing personal, he just wanted the pendant. The same hit is put on Xiangling, but in the absence of a similar heart-to-heart talk, the father implies an indifference to his daughter\\'s life. The father has enough love for just one child.An actor lives under their father\\'s roof; an actor who once impersonated Mandarin, as a decoy for Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce), a terrorist, in Shane Black\\'s \"Iron Man 3\". Trevor Slattery(Ben Kingsley), this time, has no role to play; his Fu Manchu beard is gone. He plays himself. On the surface, Trevor Slattery\\'s appearance can seem contrived, because otherwise, \"Shang Chi\" would be a stand-alone movie, untethered from the Marvel Universe. Duly noted, by countless film theorists, no doubt, Kingsley is sending-up..., who some believe was impersonating...in the network television series \"Kung Fu\". Lee, however, did star in \"The Green Hornet\", playing Kato, a sidekick to the titular star. It\\'s \"The Green Hornet\"(green, the same color as the emerald pendants), not \"Kung Fu\", that\\'s explicitly referenced in \"Shang-Chi\", especially when Xiangling instigates an escape from her father\\'s compound by literally breaking down a wall. In the getaway car, Slattery sits shotgun; he doesn\\'t get to be the hero. Katy drives. Brother and sister, the superheroes, sit in the back like VIPs. Slattery is the sidekick, not to the hero like Kato was, but to the hero\\'s best friend. Quite pointedly, in Tai Lo, the film simultaneously tweaks, but also rejects the Hollywood trope of... The native people fight their own battles. When Razor Fist(Florian Monteau), whose right hand is a machete blade, fight with the villagers, he\\'s an equal, not a savior, and also, it\\'s the prudent choice. They have a common enemy, a demonic beast with tentacles of behemoth proportions. Meanwhile, as both sides combine forces to stop this hellacious creature from being let loose into the outside world, Slattery plays dead, in an act of character arc subversion. He\\'s just a coward. Whereas in \"Enter the Dragon\", the hero saves his country, in \"Shang-Chi\", the hero saves the world.Her smile is genuine. The woman of the snow looks like a natural born domestic. The perfect wife and mother. She smiles with pride at the woodcutter\\'s cleverness, making new sandals for her and their three children. She tries them on. It\\'s a perfect fit. The betrayal is complete; she wears the wood from murdered trees. She returns to her sewing. And then, like something out of an inverted \"Vertigo\", Minokichi, seeing his wife barefoot again, perhaps, the woman of the snow comes back into the woodcutter\\'s life, a ghost from the past. Being recognized, Yuki returns to the woods feeling great shame about the unspoken vow of chastity she broke by being involved with the trees\\' enemy, a woodcutter. It was real love, though. Yuki keeps the sandals.What about Li? Did she really love The Mandarin, or did she love mankind, marrying him to protect earth from the awesome power of the ten rings.',\n",

But, where else could one possibly come across such an engrossing mix than in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where a raccoon once sent e-mails to a Russian assassin? That\\'s the beauty of \"Shang Chi;\" it propels quite enthusiastically and energetically into this vast inexplicable new terrain which only Stan Lee and his fellow artists and creators could have envisioned or foretold.

              " \"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is the latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring MCU newcomers Simu Liu as the titular character and Tony Leung as 'Wenwu' and, at last, the definitive portrayal of 'The Mandarin'. Helmed by director Destin Daniel Cretton this picture injects the perfect amount of Asian culture into this enormous franchise.The cast is stellar, especially Liu who wished this role into existence years ago on social media and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. He has brilliant on screen chemistry with co-star Awkwafina who plays 'Katy', Shang-Chi's best friend. Katy acts as the audiences lens into this world. She is just a normal person and I feel her role is pivotal in helping general audiences digest a story with this many magical elements. Thanks to Leung's performance 'Wenwu' has become one of the best MCU villains. He is the excellent blend of menacing and sympathetic with understandable motives.The fight choreography is second to none in the MCU. They linked perfectly with the set pieces created for this film. They were excellent, in particular the Bus fight scene and the final fight between Wenwu and Shang-Chi. These brilliant pieces of action were achieved through the lack of camera cuts and smooth camera movements to exhibit the skilled choreography. Along with the set pieces, the overall look of this film is stunning. There are some especially beautiful shots within the final fight scene which makes up for some of the routine Marvel tropes which this picture eventually falls into.The main themes of family and grief are incredibly heartfelt. They're told expertly through these characters and are deeply rooted in Asian culture, something this film showcases with perfection. From the Ten Rings compound to the Golden Daggers Club in Macau to the fictional land of Ta Lo, the Asian culture is always on show and this film, along with the wider MCU, benefits from it tenfold.However, this film is not as perfect as it could've been, thanks in large part to the Marvel formula which this picture falls into like many of it's predecessors. This is most apparent in the 3rd act which not only drags on for too long, but also turns into big CGI monster vs big CGI monster once again. When I believe a more grounded martial-arts style fight would've been more fitting.Overall, 'Shang-Chi' began as a breath of fresh air into this franchise, with deeply rooted themes, a gargantuan cast and stunning fight choreography until it gave in to the ordinary marvel formula which has plagued this genre since it's inception. Despite this, the future looks bright for these characters and the post-credit scene cements the titular character as an MCU mainstay for years to come.8.5/10.\",\n",

The characters are all three dimensional and the performances are heartfelt. The action and martial arts choreography is among the best of the Marvel films. The humor, fueled by Akwafina's performance, is right on point. This film dances around the edge of the rest of the Marvel Universe but it is it's own sort and its own self contained world. You do not need to know this character, or have seen any other Marvel movie to enjoy this one. Simi Liu is larger than life in the lead role. Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung, Benedict Wong, Fala Chen, and Menger Zhang are terrific in the ensemble cast. Many back story films are boring or wait too long to get into the action- not this one.

Delicious choice, love it! But, the CGI monsters as main climax villain... yuck. What a boooooring turn of events. Booo Disney and your boring aliens and the unknown are bad.

The story is strong, with moral ambivalence playing a part. The action is extremely well choreographed and, at times - and in common with the settings and costumes - quite beautiful. This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected. It is helped here by Awkwafina - playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect, yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters. Michelle Yeoh is stable and relatable. The leading character is, arguably, a little light on charisma, but this is not necessarily a bad thing given that one of the main plot threads is about Shang-Chi finding himself.\",\n",

              " \"Shang-Chi is one of Marvel Comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics, with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various Asian stereotypes. At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general.\",\n",

There were multiple wide shots of hand to hand combats that absolutely blew my mind. I could not stop smiling!The director did an absolutely fantastic job leading this film. I just wished the 2nd act of the movie was paced a bit quicker. There was some set up during the second act that I wish perhaps came at the beginning.

Simu Liu is adorable and wonderful, and although I am not a fan of Akwafina I will say she did a good job in this role, and Michelle Yeoh is always beautiful and engaging in everything she does. However, for me, Tony Leung was amazing. He conveys so many emotions effortlessly. He is not a remorseless killing machine, he has a purpose, and although misguided, he believe in it. He's also smoking hot so he has that going for him. This movie reminds me of Black Panther, both have strong story lines and are visually arresting, and they don't need the entire MCU to move the plot. I would highly recommend seeing it; you won't ne disappointed.\",\n",

              " 'This movie is better than other \"super hero\" theme movies. Fighting scenes moved to a new level. Incredible moves of different martial arts styles looks awesome. And of course a pinch of humor in a right moments.But it is quite predictable. You start to watch and you already know who will become who and so on.Overall, it is well done movie filled up with awesome special effects, great storyline. Totaly recommending to watch.',\n",
              " \"***spoilers*****I liked how they brought back the fake mandarin character. The dragons were really cool but wish they would have went more in depth about them. Also if it has been thousands of years of protecting that wall why didn't they build defenses around it or a walk way that wraps around the mountain. Just little details I noticed. Overall I thought it was a good movie and had a good story to it.\",\n",

Doesn't seem like any one knows the origin of the ten rings and if they were so powerful and obviously important, why hasn't any one or anything come looking for them in the 1000+ years? Like Black Widow, its watchable and enjoyable BUT don't look for any MCU answers, as this seems to be just a filler until the proper MCU shows are released.\",\n",
              " \"This film felt refreshing and didn't feel too much like a marvel movie. Felt like I was just watching a mythological modern film.I had a good time watching it. Only downside was some of the CGI felt very rushed at some points. But Iwas willing to overlook it as I think it is worth the watch.\",\n",

              " \"As an Asian American, it is so excited to see a new series on Asian characters. Thank you Marvel!This could be the best visual representation of Kongfu among Hollywood movies, especially the part between Shang-Chi's dad and mom.The music is amazing too.I wish the understanding to Asian culture could have been deeper tho.For example, when the history was introduced by Shangchi's Aunty, it was wooden sculpture used to visually present it. But in ancient China, when good things are documented, they were carved on stone monument and when bad things happened, they were documented in books.The essence about Yin-Yang, why Shang Chi's mom could easily handle his father's 10 rings Kong fu, was not presented clearly at all. It's a lot more than 'knowing who you are'.When I checked out writers, I think understood why. I guess at least there could have been a consultant who understood those part to help drafting the story details, because those are real gems from Asian culture and it was deep wisdom.But, these did not block me from enjoying the movie. It was a blast watching it, even for someone who grew up watching KongFu movie.\",\n",
              " \"Great movie to bring renaissance to a fantasy Kung Fu movie Genre, and it kept its Asian roots in the story and characters. Shang Chi is a great movie for its MCU introduction.

Of course it has its bad sides, but I like it anyway. Music was good. Acting wasn't bad. I was very curious about the history of the rings. I loved this character, also his sister was great. I would love to see more about Ten Rings. Anyway, the movie wasn't bad. When this movie came to the cinemas, unfortunately, the cinemas were not open in my country and I would like to watch this movie in the cinema.\",\n",

Sorry, not sorry it's so.The beginning is lame until the first action scene. And with a bit lameness between, it's a good movie.The end there come the good against the evil of course. But, with a hint of Star Wars(?)\",\n",

              " 'Shang-Chi was a joy from start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina balance the comedy and drama of the script masterfully. The movie felt grounded, which is refreshing in comparison to the spectacle of other movies released by Marvel Studios.The choreography is top notch! This film has some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences that I\\'ve seen in years and the cinematography only compliments that.The real heart of this movie comes from Tony Leung Chiu-wai. He stole the scene whenever he was on camera and had me deciding in my head if his character was evil or not, which is a quality that only enhances the \"villain\" role in any comic book movie.Lastly, the soundtrack by 88rising was beautifully curated and I hope will pave the way for more diverse album soundtracks.',\n",
              " \"There were a couple of areas where I'm like NOOOO DO SOMETHINGGGG, but I think that comes with every human and super human, faults and emotional pitfalls that create it to be more realistic to an extent. As someone who understands the desire of wanting someone who is gone back, not saying or doing the right thing at certain moments, and family issues I get it all, but sometimes I just needed it to move a different way than it was. As an Asian-American though I love to see the representation! Would have love to see even more new Asian actors, excited for what is to come!\",\n",
              " \"I have to agree with another reviewer here...it's probably the least Marvel of all the Marvel movies. Had it been edited to a certain effect, one would not be able to discern it as a Marvel film.It's a background story of Shang-Chi obviously, but in a way, I felt like Tony Leung stole a bit of the show. It's his anguish that drives the film, as without it, there wouldn't be a conflict between him and Shang. Seeing Tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a Tony Leung marathon, or at least watch Hard-Boiled again. He's always been so good at conveying emotion without words.Michelle Yeoh has small part in the film, but as always, she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent Gunpowder Milkshake as the older, wise Auntie.Simu Liu and Awkwafina have good chemistry in the film, but I actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat, as there was not much time spent on character development. Or at least in the character of Shang, alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with Simu in the present day, fleshing out his character. They seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? Awkwafina is vital to a plot moment, but otherwise, she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough.Morris is cute. I need to find that stuffed animal...The special effects are fun to watch and colorful.The plot is a bit simplistic, as it usually is with Marvel films. It's serviceable enough, but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3-1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least I haven't worked out why they should make sense). The fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film, it's just not as interesting to me personally.All in all, a good time and a great prelude to a Labor Day weekend!\",\n",
              " \"What an amazing movie by Marvel Studios! I was hyped for the movie since the first teaser and the movie actually exceedes my expectations. Marvel has been showing its MARVELous magic since Ironman, and Shang-Chi is another diamond in the crown. After the end of MCU's phase 3, fans were eagerly waiting for a big movie. Black Widow was not up to the mark and Eternals also disappointed majority of fans, but Chang-Chi filled their gap. The action scenes were fresh and engaging. Martial arts combined with chinese mythological powers makes these action scenes more interesting. Character arc and story building were satisfying. They were not rushed or slow paced. Whole movie was engaging till the end. I would love to see another movie of this franchise.\",\n",
