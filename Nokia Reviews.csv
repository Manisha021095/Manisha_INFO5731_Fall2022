Need improvement in picture scaling and quality.Overall good,"decent tv overall. awesome sound(best in market). Regarding picture quality, it is good for 4k and hd content. Found certain lags in Youtube App like while increasing volume, the sound/video drops to the next frame. Also, picture settings are very limited. MEMC is disappointing as it makes audio out of sync with the video. It had to be turned off. SD Content upscaling is not that good. Price -wise it is value for money.READ MORE"

Good choice,"Picture and sound quality is very good. Screen bleeding issue is there which Nokia needs to give more attention. There is lag in every content while mirroring mobile with TV which is very disappointing. Also major ports are on back panel instead of side panel which makes difficult for connecting wire, so you need buy movable joint support (for wall mounting) worth of 1500rs from the installation guy who comes at your home during demo. P.S. Average product comparing with other good brand TV.READ MORE"
Horrible,"I had  a huge expecions because of the nokia brand, Once the order is delivered totally disappointed.

I hope in future they change the display quality.READ MORE"
Worst TV! Lines and spots appearing in 48 hours!,"1. Thick lines started appearing on TV within 48 hours of installation and less than 2 hours of use. Very disappointed with this. I can't afford to buy another and replacement/warranty visits during COVID-19 in Mumbai can be risky. Will never order again.2. Less than two months of use, the TV screen is starting to show SPOTS on it. This is despicable and a complete breach of trust. Please do not buy this pathetic excuse of a TV!

"Amazing display, great sound, best TV in this price range","This is one of the best TV in this price range. It has JBL audio with dolby which sounds great specially when I listen the music. Picture quality is amazing, I tried with 4k and it renders graphics without any glitch.There were couple of minor issue that I've faced which was resolved after upgrading android TV to latest version. One thing I don't like is remote, sometimes it's not very responsive and you need to press a button multiple times to get the things done.READ MORE"

Just wow!,Best 4K TV in this price range compared to oneplus Q1 this TV is more awesome. Sound By JBL is crystal clear and amazing and you don't need extra home theatre for sound. So many people have faced screen issue but I don't think this happens with everyone. Just go for it.READ MORE
Really Nice,"The product ia really amazing and worth the amount it is priced at, the only issue that arises often is of internet connectivity. Generally, it performs perfectly on wifi but you don't get the claimed speed without LAN connectivity. Moreover, you need to refresh the WLAN option frequently. So incase you're planning to wall mount the unit, please arrange an extra length of LAN cable.READ MORE"
Fair,everything is good but there is screen bleeding issueREAD MORE

Waste of money!,Worst... After sale don't care your company or flipkart as well. There is no contact details to report any problems. Only computerized answering numbers it totally fu** all numbers of nokia and flipkart too.READ MORE
